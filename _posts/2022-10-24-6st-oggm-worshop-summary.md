Almost a year after the [5th OGGM workshop in Neuharlingersiel](https://oggm.org/2021/10/12/5th-oggm-worshop-summary/), 
it was time for the next chapter, in a series that has brought together the community of users, developers and friends 
of OGGM. After what was for most of us a long day of traveling and a beautiful train 
journey, we arrived in Finse, a remote village between Bergen and Oslo, that can only be reached by train. All that 
was remaining of our journey was a 20 minute walk to the [research station](www.finse.uio.no) through the alpine tundra 
with the some of the outlet glaciers of the near by ice cap insight, before receiving a warm welcome by the station manager, 
the cooks and the workshop participants that arrived a little earlier. This year’s workshop was jointly organized with 
the Python Glacier Evolution Model (PyGEM) community and for the first time the workshop did not solely focused on OGGM. 
PyGEM, ODINN, COSIPY and GloGEM were also present. 

The program consisted of presentations, mostly in the mornings, by the participants that were grouped together in 
the thematic sessions: "<i>Recent developments in global glacier modeling</i>", “<i>Glacier-related hydrology and data</i>” 
and “<i>Glacier evolution, past and future, ensemble studies and intercomparison</i>”. The presentations ranged from 
longer overview presentations, to presentations of latest results and short pitches of new ideas. During the afternoons 
there were hands-on tutorials in PyGEM and OGGM for beginners and OGGM for more advanced users. In addition there 
were discussion sessions. 

Having this year a broader audience resulted in some overarching discussions. The one I found personally particularly 
interesting, was about the “<i>relationship and potential for marriage</i>” of OGGM and PyGEM. One of the great things 
of OGGM is that it is modular and open source, making it very easy for others to use just the part they need and combine 
it with their own cuisine. Having an agreement on in- and output formats of the different modules, is essential in this 
context of this modeling framework. Agreeing with others like PyGEM to use the same workflow, would come with great 
benefits. This can avoid needing to repeat certain exercises, making intercomparisions way easier and increase the options 
one could choice from. 
Before the discussion started this marriage between these to models seemed inevitable for me, especially because PyGEM 
already uses parts of OGGM. However some strong arguments during the discussion turned this upside down. To the outside 
world it might give of a wrong impression if everything takes place within one framework and might make it seems less 
reliable. But maybe more importantly, agreeing on one workflow, which in this case has the minimum of being glacier 
entity based, put you on a track where no longer everything is possible. For science that could be harmful. This doesn’t 
mean committing to the same workflow is necessarily “wrong”, there should only stay general awareness that this can 
be restriction, and that space should remain in the global glacier modeling community for tackling questions with 
another approach and that moving with all models to the same framework would for this reason not be desirable.  

The excursion to the nearby glacier was for some of us the first time a seeing a glacier up close, making it a wonderful 
experience setting foot on one, especially considering that all of us are doing glacier research. For one of us it was a
more like a dream coming true that had involved months of commited preperation, but also to those with plenty of 
experience in the field, visiting a glacier keeps being amazing. The hike to the glacier was also a good opportunity 
to mingle and socialize, and so was the icebreaker, a ice and climate pub quiz where the more senior scientists were 
the mascots of their teams. Living for some days together in one place was great for getting to know each other a 
little better and formed I think a nice basis for exchanging knowledge and further collaborations. 

I’m already looking forward to the next edition :)
