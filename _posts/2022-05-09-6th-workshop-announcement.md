### What is it ?

**The workshop is the 6<sup>th</sup> in a series that has brought together the community of users 
and developers of the Open Global Glacier Model ([OGGM](oggm.org)). This year's workshop 
is organized jointly with the Python Glacier Evolution Model ([PyGEM](https://github.com/drounce/PyGEM)) 
community. It is open to anybody interested in global glacier modeling with focus on 
active developers and users of OGGM or PyGEM. The primary goal is to discuss the challenges 
and solutions in modeling glaciers at large scales, to learn from each other, and to develop 
ideas and visions for the advancement of such models. The workshop will include scientific 
presentations, hands-on coding sessions, discussion/brainstorming sessions, and generally 
be held in an informal manner (with a possible hike to a nearby glacier).**

### Agenda

The workshop will include:

1. <b>Scientific presentations</b> by the participants (ca. 15-20 min) on topics related to the theme of the workshop. 
These can include the state, recent developments and results of large-scale glacier modeling.
2. <b>Discussion/brainstorming sessions</b> focused on topics of interest, such as future developments and visions for global glacier models.
3. <b>Hands-on sessions</b> in smaller groups including:
    - Beginner tutorials: these sessions are for current and future OGGM/PyGEM users to learn how to set-up and customize a model run.
    - Advanced tutorials: on topics such as <i>How to contribute to OGGM/PyGEM</i>, <i>use OGGM/PyGEM with your own data</i>, or <i>use parts of OGGM/PyGEM with another model</i>.
    - Q&A session: on model problems and possible solutions.
4.  <b>Glacier excursion</b>: Weather and snow conditions permitting we also plan a ½ day excursion to one of the nearby outlet glaciers of the Hardangerjøkulen Ice Cap.

We like to keep the schedule flexible in order to meet the needs, interests and suggestions 
of the participants. Tentatively, we plan to have presentations mostly in the mornings and 
group discussions and hand-on sessions in the afternoons. 

### Who can participate ?
Anyone working on large-scale glaciological modeling, in particular using OGGM or PyGEM, 
but also any other global glacier modeler keen on learning more about OGGM/PyGEM! In particular, 
we would like to encourage model users (current and future) as well as model developers to join 
us. The number of participants is limited to approximately 30 due to the housing limitations 
at the Finse Research Center. Therefore users and developers of OGGM or PyGEM will be given 
priority in case interest exceeds capacity.

### Location
The workshop will be held at the [Finse Alpine Research Center](https://www.finse.uio.no) 
run by Oslo and Bergen University. The station is located near the >70 km2 Hardangerjøkulen 
Ice Cap with one of the outlet glaciers only a couple of km away and well visible from the 
Research Station. Finse is a tiny mountain village with only a few houses located at the 
Oslo - Bergen railroad at 1,222 meters (4,009 ft) above sea level, about 250 m above the 
treeline. There is no road to Finse. Facilities are very limited, e.g., there is no grocery 
store, pharmacy or bank. In mid September the weather can be highly variable. Air temperatures 
may fall below freezing and heavy snowfall may occur combined with high winds.

### Transportation
Finse is only accessible by train, from either Oslo central station (Oslo S) (ca. 4.5 hrs; 
ca. 6 trains per day between ca. 6:00 and 23:00; ca. 600 NOK one way) or Bergen (ca. 2.5 hrs). 
Tickets can be bought at [www.vy.no](https://www.vy.no). From the Gardermoen Airport, Oslo central station 
can be reached by train in 20-30 minutes (many trains per hour). From Finse train station it is 
a 15-20 minute walk (ca. 1.5 km) along a small dirt road/hiking path to the research station 
(which may be snow-covered at that time).

<b> Airport Gardemoen to Oslo </b>

From the airport you need to take a train to the central train station (Oslo S ) where the train to Finse departs. 
Turn to the right when getting out of customs and walk about 50 m where you can buy the train ticket to Oslo at a 
counter or ticket machine. There are 2 independent companies selling tickets side by side:
1) flytoget (flight train), fastest, ca. 20 minutes, 220 NOK
2) ´normal´ train by company ´vy´, ca. 30 minutes, 115 NOK. This train may actually get you faster to Oslo depending when you get there since it goes more often. Trains R10, R11 and L12 go to Oslo.

You can also buy the tickets online (www.vy.no or https://flytoget.no/en/).
From the ticket counter/machines it is a 2 minute walk to the platform (down an escalator).

### Arrival / departure dates
The workshop starts at Finse on 16 September with dinner and ends on 21 September after 
breakfast. The Research Station closes on 21 September for winter, therefore one needs to leave 
the facility latest in the early afternoon on that day. Thus we recommend all participants flying 
into Oslo Gardermoen to land 16 September in the morning and book a return flight not earlier than late 
afternoon on Sept. 21.

### Accommodation / meals
All participants will be housed at the Finse Research Station which has a number of 2-4 bed 
rooms which participants will share. We will be the only group at the station at that time. 
A cook at the station will provide all meals for the workshop. The station has a lecture hall 
and internet (4G eduroam and University of Oslo guest login).

### Workshop fee
<strike>The final workshop fee is not confirmed yet, but we anticipate ca. 250 NOK/person/night for accommodation 
and ca. 900 NOK/person/day for meals.</strike>
The workshop fee including meals and accommodation is 5125 NOK.

### Packing list

<b>Workshop necessities</b>
- Laptop for the hands-on sessions (the wifi connection goes through eduroam)
